This is a sentence to get to the end of the line.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas lobortis fermentum feugiat. Sed porta dui nec tellus condimentum, non hendrerit justo vulputate. Curabitur ultrices dui a urna interdum, nec consectetur felis tincidunt. Nullam tempor purus malesuada turpis malesuada ullamcorper.

**This sentence is bolded.**

*This sentence is italicized.*

You should use \<strong\> and em tags in html because `<b>` and `<i>` just mean what it looks like, strong and em are what they actually mean. Markdown uses strong and em .

To write `<b>` and `<i>` just type `` `<b>` `` wherever you want it and it will show `<b>`(you can write i in there to show `<i>`)

* This is an unordered list item
* Here is another one

0. This is an ordered list
